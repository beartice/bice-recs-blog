Hello friend,

I'm Bice and this is going to be my little review corner.

I always loved to share my opinion and thoughts about what i was watching or reading at the moment, and I recently sat down with my self and decided that I was going to do something about it, something to share with the rest of the world my perspective on stuff. A lot of stuff.

Mostly, I watch a lot of tv series and movies but I don't have a favourite genre, I just watch whatever seems cool enough from the trailer or whatever catches my eye when I'm bored and I'v reached the bottom of my to watch list lol.

I hope that you will find this smol blog intresting and funny, and that my insights on stuff will make you curious about it.

See ya,

Bice
